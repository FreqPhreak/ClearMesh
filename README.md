Project Discontinuation Notice

After careful consideration, I have decided to discontinue my involvement with this project. While MeshCore is presented as an open-source initiative, I have concerns about its evolving direction and the way its development model is being structured.

The primary reasons for this decision are:

    Concerns About Open-Source Integrity: Although MeshCore is labeled as open-source, certain features are being monetized through in-app purchases. This approach does not fully align with the open-access principles I prioritize in my work.

    Shift Toward a Business-Oriented Model: Over time, the project appears to be moving toward a more commercial framework, which differs from the decentralized and community-driven ethos that initially attracted me.

    External Influences on Project Direction: While contributions from various sources have helped shape the project, recent developments suggest a growing emphasis on monetization. This shift coincides with increased promotion from external platforms, which may be influencing its trajectory.

Given these concerns, I have decided to step away from the project and will not be supplying any code that I have already worked on. I prefer to dedicate my efforts to initiatives that align more closely with open-source collaboration and accessibility.

I appreciate the support and engagement from the community and encourage anyone interested to explore independent alternatives that uphold open-source principles.
